// The World Chess Championship 2022 is about to start. A total of 14 Classical games will be played between Chef and Carlsen in the championship. Each game can have one of three outcomes â€” it can be won by Carlsen, won by Chef, or it can be a draw. The winner of a game receives 2 points, and the loser receives 0 points. If the game is a draw, both players get 1 point each.

// The total prize pool of the championship is 100 * X. At the end of the 14 Classical games, if one player has strictly more points than the other, he is declared the champion and receives 60 * X as his prize money, while the loser receives 40 * X.

// If the total points are tied, then the defending champion Carlsen is declared the winner. In this case, Carlsen receives 55 * X as his prize money, and the other player receives 45 * X.
